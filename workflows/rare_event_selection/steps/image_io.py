"""
image_io — Image loading shared by the workflow steps.

OME-Zarr and OME-TIFF are read through the same contract, so a step works
the same either way: pick a plane with level / t / c / z and get back a 2D
YX array plus a metadata dict of the same shape.

  * OME-Zarr is read with ngio, which covers NGFF 0.4 and 0.5 behind one
    API. One Zarr per position, axes TCZYX.
  * TIFF is read with tifffile, and its OME-XML with ome-types. Both are
    light and pull nothing else into the step environment. tifffile
    exposes a TIFF as a Zarr array, so both formats reach the same plane
    selection code.
  * skimage covers PNG/JPEG and the sample datasets, and is imported only
    when one of those is actually asked for.

Reads stay lazy in both formats: only the chunks, shards or tiles backing
the requested plane are fetched, so a position costs one plane of memory
rather than the whole TCZYX array, and a z-projection reduces over one
z-stack.

The analysis steps are 2D, so loading always returns a single YX plane.
