"""
Internal pipeline state and YAML parsing.

Not part of the public API. Used by the Engine to manage registered
pipelines, track jobs, handle scope completion, and accumulate results.

Phases
------
A pipeline's step list is split into phases at scope boundaries:

    Phase 0 (immediate):   preprocess -> segment     [runs per job]
    -- scope: group --
    Phase 1 (scoped):      stitch -> features         [runs once per group]
    -- scope: all --
    Phase 2 (scoped):      normalize                   [runs once for all]

Phase 0 has no scope trigger -- it runs immediately when a job is submitted.
Subsequent phases wait for scope completion signals.

Scope matching
--------------
When complete="X" is signaled from a submit with scope={"X": val}:
  - If "X" is a key in jobs' scope dicts: match by value (scope["X"] == val)
  - If "X" is not a key: collect everything from the previous phase

This means "all" is not special -- it works because no job has "all" as a
scope key, so the engine collects everything.
