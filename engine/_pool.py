"""
WorkerPool -- Per-environment worker pools with dynamic scaling.

Manages worker subprocesses organized by conda environment. Workers are
created on demand and scale up to the per-step max_workers limit. Idle
workers are reaped after a configurable timeout.

Architecture
------------
Each environment gets an _EnvPool that tracks idle and busy workers.
The WorkerPool routes execute() calls to the right _EnvPool and enforces
per-step concurrency via semaphores.

Per-step concurrency
--------------------
max_workers is a per-step limit, not per-environment. A semaphore per
step path ensures no more than max_workers instances of the same step
run concurrently, even across different pipelines.

Thread safety
-------------
- _pool_lock protects _env_pools dict during creation.
- _sem_lock protects _step_semaphores dict during creation.
- Each _EnvPool has its own lock for idle/busy tracking.
- Reaper thread runs every 30s to shut down idle workers.
